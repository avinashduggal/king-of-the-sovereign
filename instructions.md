> **Note:** This is a pilot project intended to promote unusual but meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and peace studies. The following is an interesting research by Meta. This rulebook was inspired by the Diplomacy board game. I drafted this rulebook with a help of an AI agent. There could be some ambiguity in the definition (mainly because the state and action of the original Diplomacy game was too huge to simply..., but I tried my best.). If you find any issue or unclear definitions, please report it to me.

## 1. Overview

SOVEREIGN is a deterministic-core, stochastic-politics strategic simulation designed as a Gymnasium-compatible environment for deep reinforcement learning research. It models a three-nation geopolitical conflict in which one nation (the Invader) holds a clear military advantage and must decide how to pursue its strategic objectives through a joint military–political action space.

**The central research question the environment is designed to probe:** *Can a militarily superior agent learn, through experience alone, that invasion is a strategically dominated strategy?*

The environment does not punish invasion by fiat. The cost of aggression emerges organically through the interaction of political legitimacy, economic attrition, occupation drag, and shifting international coalitions.

---

## 2. Nations

The game is played with exactly three nations. Their roles are fixed at initialization.

| Nation | Role | Starting Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Invader (I) | The learning agent. Controls the DRL policy. | Hard-power advantage: 2× military units, higher strike capacity |
| Defender (D) | Rule-based opponent. Responds to Invader actions. | Home-turf advantage: +20% unit effectiveness on own territory |
| Neutral (N) | Stochastic observer. Posture shifts based on Invader behavior. | Begins at θ = 0 (true neutral) |

### 2.1 Hard-Power Asymmetry

The Invader begins the game with a deliberate and significant military advantage. This is a design requirement, not a coincidence. The thesis of the environment is that a superior agent learns that invasion is irrational. If the Invader were weak, the result would be trivially explained by military inferiority.

**Default initialization:**

```
Invader:   12 ground units,  3 strike units,  supply index = 1.0
Defender:   6 ground units,  1 strike unit,   supply index = 1.0
Neutral:    4 ground units,  0 strike units   (non-combatant at θ = 0)
```

## 3. The Game Board

The map is a graph `G = (V, E)` where nodes are territories and edges are adjacency (movement is permitted only along edges).

### 3.1 Territories

Each territory `v ∈ V` has three attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| controller | {I, D, N, Contested} | Which nation controls the territory |
| resource_value | Float [0, 1] | Economic output contributed per step if controlled |
| strategic_value | Float [0, 1] | Military significance (affects supply lines) |

### 3.2 Supply Lines

A nation's supply index `E ∈ [0, 1]` is computed each step as a function of territory connectivity. Occupied territories that are not contiguous with the Invader's home territory generate no resource value and increase occupation cost.

### 3.3 Default Map

The default map has 9 territories: 3 home territories (one per nation) and 6 contested territories. You can create one sample topology. Also, you can consider testing the performance in other topologies. (Show at least one map.)

---

## 4. State Space

At each timestep *t*, the environment emits a state vector *s_t* comprising the following components.

### 4.1 State Variables

| Variable | Symbol | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Territory control map | M | Binary matrix \|V\| x 3 | One-hot encoding of controller per territory |
| Military strength | U_I, U_D | Integer vector | Unit counts per territory for Invader and Defender |
| International legitimacy | L | Float [0, 1] | Invader's standing in the international community |
| Economic supply index | E | Float [0, 1] | Invader's economic and logistical health |
| Neutral posture | θ | Float [-1, +1] | Neutral nation's alignment |
| Occupation duration | t_occ | Integer ≥ 0 | Consecutive steps the Invader has held non-home territory |

**Bold variables are the soul of the design.** They are the mechanisms through which the long-run cost of aggression manifests. Ablating any of them materially changes the agent's optimal policy.

### 4.2 Legitimacy L

L represents the Invader's international standing. It begins at `L = 1.0` and decays under aggressive action. It recovers slowly under diplomatic action.

- Governs how the Neutral nation responds to the Invader
- Determines whether sanctions are imposed (threshold event at θ > 0.6)
- Terminal collapse condition: L = 0

### 4.3 Neutral Posture θ

`θ ∈ [-1, +1]` encodes the Neutral nation's political alignment:

```
θ = -1.0   →  fully allied with Invader (supply routes open, no sanctions)
θ =  0.0   →  true neutral
θ = +1.0   →  fully allied with Defender (sanctions active, military support)
```

See [Section 7](#7-neutral-posture-system) for the full posture shift model.

### 4.4 Occupation Duration t_occ

t_occ is a monotonically increasing counter that resets only if the Invader withdraws all units from non-home territory. It drives:

- Per-step occupation cost (linear in t_occ)
- Insurgency probability `p(insurgency | t_occ)` — a stochastic event that destroys one Invader unit per occurrence

## 5. Turn Structure

Each game step proceeds in the following fixed sequence:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STEP t                                                 │
│                                                         │
│  1.  Observe state s_t                                  │
│  2.  Invader selects political action  a_pol            │
│  3.  Invader selects military action   a_mil            │
│  4.  Defender responds (rule-based policy)              │
│  5.  Resolve military outcomes (deterministic)          │
│  6.  Update territory control map M                     │
│  7.  Update L, E, t_occ                                 │
│  8.  Sample Neutral posture shift  Δθ                   │
│  9.  Check threshold events (sanctions, coalition)      │
│  10. Check terminal conditions                          │
│  11. Compute reward  r_t                                │
│  12. Emit  (s_{t+1}, r_t, done, info)                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The political action is committed before the military action. This is a deliberate design constraint. The agent cannot use military force as a substitute for political reasoning within a single step.

---

## 6. Action Space

The Invader's action at each step is a joint action `a = (a_pol, a_mil)`.

### 6.1 Political Actions A_pol

| Action | Effect on L | Effect on θ | Effect on E |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEEK_ALLIANCE | +0.01 | −0.05 (toward Invader) | — |
| IMPOSE_SANCTION | −0.02 | +0.04 (toward Defender) | −0.03 (target) |
| ISSUE_THREAT | −0.03 | +0.03 | — |
| NEGOTIATE | +0.03 | −0.04 | — |
| DO_NOTHING | Slow decay if L < 0.5 | Slow drift if t_occ > 0 | — |

### 6.2 Military Actions A_mil

| Action | Territory effect | Effect on L | Effect on t_occ |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADVANCE | Claim adjacent territory | −0.05 | +1 per step in non-home |
| HOLD | Maintain current positions | — | +1 per step in non-home |
| WITHDRAW | Cede one contested territory | +0.02 | Resets if full withdrawal |
| STRIKE | Destroy one Defender unit | −0.08 | +1 |

## 7. Neutral Posture System

This section describes the most nuanced mechanism in the environment.

### 7.1 Drift-Diffusion Model

Neutral posture evolves according to:

```
θ_{t+1} = clip( θ_t  +  μ(s_t, a_t)  +  ε,  −1, +1 )

where  ε ~ N(0, σ²),   σ = 0.02  (default)
```

The deterministic drift μ encodes the rational response of the international community to observable Invader behavior. The stochastic noise ε models the irreducible uncertainty of international politics.

### 7.2 Drift Function

```
μ(s_t, a_t) = + α · (1 − L)          # low legitimacy alienates neutral
             + β · [a_mil = ADVANCE]  # territorial advance shocks posture
             + γ · [a_mil = STRIKE]   # strikes carry heavier cost
             − δ · [a_pol = NEGOTIATE]# diplomacy pulls posture toward center
             − ε · [a_pol = SEEK_ALLIANCE]  # alliance-seeking reduces drift
             + ζ · (t_occ / T_max)   # prolonged occupation steadily alienates
```

**Default coefficients:**

| Coefficient | Symbol | Default value |
|---|---|---|
| Legitimacy coupling | α | 0.04 |
| Advance shock | β | 0.05 |
| Strike shock | γ | 0.10 |
| Negotiate pull | δ | 0.04 |
| Alliance pull | ε | 0.03 |
| Occupation drift | ζ | 0.03 |

### 7.3 Threshold Events

When θ crosses discrete thresholds, irreversible geopolitical events are triggered:

| Threshold | Event | Mechanical Effect |
|---|---|---|
| θ > 0.60 | Neutral imposes sanctions | Invader E reduced by 0.01/step |
| θ > 0.85 | Neutral joins Defender | Defender receives +2 units; Invader L −0.10 |
| θ < −0.60 | Neutral opens supply routes | Invader occupation cost reduced 30% |
| θ < −0.85 | Neutral formally allies Invader | Defender E reduced; L −0.05 |

**Design note:** Thresholds are one-directional by default. Once sanctions are imposed, they are not lifted unless θ falls back below 0.50 and stays there for 5 consecutive steps. This hysteresis models the political difficulty of reversing international coalitions.

---

## 8. Reward Function

The reward at each step is:

```
r_t = r_pos(s_t, a_t)  −  r_neg(s_t, a_t)
```

### 8.1 Positive Terms

| Component | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Territory control | w_T · Σ resource_value(v) for v controlled by I | Economic yield of held territory |
| Resource capture | w_R · Δ(controlled resources) | Bonus for newly captured territory |

### 8.2 Negative Terms (per step)

| Component | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Occupation cost | w_O · t_occ / T_max | Linear cost of sustained occupation |
| Legitimacy loss | w_L · (1 − L) | Penalty proportional to legitimacy deficit |
| Sanction penalty | w_S · [θ > 0.6] · (1 − E) | Active when sanctions threshold crossed |
| Insurgency event | w_I · Bernoulli(p(insurgency \| t_occ)) | Stochastic unit destruction |

**Default weights:**

| Weight | Default |
|---|---|
| w_T | 0.30 |
| w_R | 0.20 |
| w_O | 0.25 |
| w_L | 0.15 |
| w_S | 0.20 |
| w_I | 0.10 |

### 8.3 Insurgency Probability

```
p(insurgency | t_occ) = 1 − exp(−λ · t_occ)

Default:  λ = 0.05
```

This is a standard reliability-theory hazard function. At t_occ = 10, insurgency probability per step is approximately 40%. At t_occ = 20, it exceeds 63%.

## 9. Terminal Conditions

An episode ends when any of the following conditions is met:

| Condition | Type | Terminal Reward |
|---|---|---|
| L ≤ 0 | Political collapse | −50 (large penalty) |
| All Invader units destroyed | Military defeat | −30 |
| Negotiated settlement reached | Diplomatic resolution | +40 (large bonus) |
| t ≥ T_max | Time limit | 0 (no bonus) |
| Invader controls all territories | Total conquest | +10 (intentionally modest) |

---

## 10. The Core Experimental Protocol

Train the agent under varying parameter regimes and measure whether the peace-dominant policy emerges:

| Experiment | L active | t_occ active | θ active | Expected optimal policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Full model | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Negotiate or deter |
| No legitimacy | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | Slower invasion |
| No occupation cost | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | Partial invasion |
| No neutral posture | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | Invasion |
| Baseline (all off) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | Always invade |

Also, analyze the impact of different parameter values. (e.g., if the sanction starts earlier, does it change the behavior of the invader?)
